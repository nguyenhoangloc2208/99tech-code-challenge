###Issue:

  - Missing Imports and Undefined Data Types: React library, BoxProps, useMemo are not imported. Data types for variables like blockchain and lhsPriority are not properly defined.
  
  - Unused Variables and Functions: Some variables like balancePriority, lhsPriority are not used in the code.
  
  - Undefined Functions and Variables: The WalletRow function is not defined, and the classes variable is not defined.
  
  - Component WalletPage Not Exported: The WalletPage component is not exported.
  
###Solution:

  - Import Necessary Libraries and Define Data Types: Import React library, BoxProps, and useMemo. Properly define data types for variables like blockchain and lhsPriority.
  
  - Remove Unused Variables and Functions: Remove unused variables and functions like balancePriority and lhsPriority to clean up the code.
  
  - Define WalletRow Function and classes Variable: Define the WalletRow function and classes variable to resolve undefined function and variable errors.
  
  - Export WalletPage Component: Export the WalletPage component to make it accessible for use elsewhere in the codebase.
